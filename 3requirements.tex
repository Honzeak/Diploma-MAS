\section{Requirements definition}

This section will be mainly devoted to defining what should the proposed system be capable of in terms 
of functionality. In the previous section, general guidelines on which ITS solution the proposed 
framework should aim to be able to simulate were discussed. This section will expand on it, 
going into more details and processes how to achieve a system that is both modular enough to support 
a wide range of ITS solution simulation and, at the same time, offering enough facilitation value 
for streamlining development of ITS simulations. 

Another outcome of this section will be to determine which toolset to use to facilitate building of 
the architecture. Ideally, an existing library for agent-based modelling could be used, which has got 
the elementary structure defined according to our proposed specifications.

Furthermore, regarding the topic of this thesis, the inductive approach of analyzing actors and
processes of Various ITS solutions will then be used to validate the proposed framework. The
framework will be designed using knowledge (e.g. optimal agent architecture) researched in the
past section (\ref{mas}).  Consequentially, an optimal ITS solution will be chosen to implement
using the proposed framework, which will serve both as a proof-of-concept and as a benchmark
for evaluation of the framework.  

\subsection{System requirements}

As has been stated in the introduction, this section will be dedicated to propose logical
requirements for the system architecture and model. Defining such requirements will ensure that
functionality identified in both the inductive system decomposition in section (\ref{its}),
i.e. the ITS solutions review, and the deductive approach in section (\ref{mas}), which 
outlines the basis how multi-agent systems are modeled, will be met. This should result 
in a ITS virtual-deployment framework that is highly modular and capable of simulating large 
number of ITS. The requirements are summarized in the table (\ref{sys-requirements}) below.

    \caption{Proposed system requirements}
    \centering\begin{tabular}{>{\footnotesize}p{.9\textwidth}}
        \toprule 
\textbf{Requirement 1}: The framework should be a multi-agent based system, supporting more actors 
that are able to act independently, having their own logic and able to make decisions based on their 
own perception of the environment.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 2}: The framework will be based on the \textsubscript{3}T architecture. 
This primarily means implementation of the three layers of logic that interact between each other and thus 
offer complex behaviour modelling - Deliberation, sequencing and skill layers.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 4}: The implementation of a particular ITS-agent's elementary
capability should be done using skill modules, each of them serving one purpose. The skill modules must provide a
pre-defined input and output interface.
\\ \midrule
\\textbf{Requirement 1}: An agent should be able to communicate with others through a dedicated communication module/skill 
that will manage the communication.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 4}: Agents should be able to act upon received information from their sensory and communication interfaces
and dynamically adjust their plans using the deliberation and sequencing layer.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 7}: Sensory and communication capability of an agent will be incorporated 
as a separate skill module.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 5}: Where applicable, agents should be able to detect conflicting intentions with other agents
while executing their tasks. The conflict detection will be implemented as a module on the reactive layer.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 4}: Agents should resolve conflicts using the ACL communication
specification, and comply with its requirements, mentioned in section \ref{sec-acl}. An
interface to support basic negotiations utilizing abstraction ACL messages should be provided.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 3}: The framework's architecture should be modular enough to support broad 
spectrum of ITS implementation, including but not exclusive to C-ITS solutions.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 3}: The framework should support C-ITS messaging services (Decentralized
Environmental Notification Basic Service (DENM) \& Cooperative Awareness Basic Service (CAM))
out-of-the-box and according to their specifications.
\\ \midrule
\textbf{Requirement 2}: The supported communication modes will be both direct (messaging specific agents) and indirect  
(broadcast \& subscription).

% \subsection{Implementation}

% In relation to the topic of this thesis, it is important to define ITS features that will create a
% qualitative analysis/benchmark for identifying suitable system(s) for the ITS implementation. The following 
% sections will discuss selected features that will be used for deciding which system to implement as a demonstration
% of the proposed agent-based framework.

% deployment.  choosing which ITS to develop 
%  regarding the thesis, Because all of the GDT seem
% to be more or less distinct
% activities, the table below (\ref{gdt-mapping}) was created to map each GDT to particular C-ITS system, which
% will be used to narrow down the potential ITS implementation candidates and hopefully make the final
% decision for ITS implementation clear. 

\subsection{Qualitative analysis}

Looking at the table (\ref{gdt-mapping}), it is evident that all the tasks fall under \emph{four} 
mapping types. Those will be used as entries in the qualitative analysis. Nevertheless,
all types of ITS considered in the preceding sections will be examined and subsequently
evaluated to decide which type of ITS would be the most optimal to implement. 

The method to determine how well-suited the candidate system type is for the implementation to an IVS 
will be to evaluate it based on the \emph{three} features discussed in the preceding sections: 

\begin{itemize}
    \itemspacing{.5}
    \item MAS-compatibility
    \item Driver engagement
    \item Research relevance
\end{itemize}

A set of integer values will determine significance of each feature. The significance
will be given in four levels:

\begin{itemize}
    \itemspacing{.5}
    \item \talign{None}{5}{$\rightarrow$\quad 0}
    \item \talign{Low}{5}{$\rightarrow$\quad 2}
    \item \talign{Moderate}{5}{$\rightarrow$\quad 5}
    \item \talign{High}{5}{$\rightarrow$\quad 8}
\end{itemize}
