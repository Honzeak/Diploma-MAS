\section{Introduction}

The goal of this thesis is to investigate multi-agent systems (MAS) and their principles and evaluate the usages of these systems related to ITS research, where 
their shared characteristics of distributed interoperability make
agent-based modelling a strong tool for simulating ITS solutions. The output of 
the experimental/practical part of the thesis is a MAS-based simulation framework 
for facilitating the process of ITS solutions simulation with the benefit 
of modular and fast extensibility.

In the first two chapters, a review of the state-of-art research on Intelligent 
Transport Systems and Multi-agent Systems are presented, discussing the important 
features related to the main topic of the thesis. This research leads to the definition of system
requirements that are described in the third chapter. In the 
fourth section, a framework architecture model is proposed, in line with 
MAS paradigms and adapted for ITS solutions simulation. In the fifth section, the
usage and requirements of tools for framework development are discussed, mainly describing the simulator software integration
and additional development platforms and libraries that could potentially facilitate the
framework design process. In the sixth section, a technical implementation of the 
framework is presented, showing the implementation details while also serving as the 
software's documentation. In section number seven, a validation of the proposed 
system is conducted by implementing a distributed cooperative ITS system into the
IVS, using the proposed framework and assessing its performance and overall results.

\subsection{Introduction to the problematic}

In a world where vehicle transport plays an inseparable role in society, with an ever-increasing
demand, it is important to analyze and study driver behaviour and inherently interactions and
relationships between drivers and their surroundings. This is supported by the fact that, even though
substantial advancements in autonomous driving are being made, for the near future, vehicles 
will be controlled by humans and therefore be exposed to a substantial risk of danger. 
Data shows that about 95 \% of traffic accidents are a result of human error \cite{Parliament2021}. 
Each traffic accident has got a tremendous effect on socioeconomic growth. A study by the European
Union states that accident-related expenses (including cost of fatality) cost 1,8 \% of EU GDP \cite{Wijnen2017}.  
A rather non-cynical point of view is that each life lost is a failure in society itself and an effort
should be made to diminish fatal accidents.

A method that has proven to be effective at studying driver behaviour and
traffic safety is by using interactive vehicle simulators (IVS), which allow to
undertake experiments in a safe, controlled and reproducible way \cite{Winter2012}.  Because
the driving simulator is a digital twin of a real vehicle, it is naturally
reasonable to make the interaction between the driver and IVS as close to
reality as possible, which inherently improves the trustworthiness of acquired data from experiments
and potentially also the range of IVS applications. The IVS has got a broad
spectrum of utilization. It is not only used as a tool to research driver
behaviour, but also used in development and testing of advanced
driver-assistance systems, extending the simulator to a hardware-in-the-loop or
a vehicle-in-the-loop software, which enables to test real hardware and simulate
full road testing \cite{Horvath2019}.

Simulating the traffic environment is a complex problem, mainly because of
its highly dynamic characteristics. All vehicles need to interact with
each other and act upon other drivers' actions. Because agent-based simulations
have proven to model complex behaviour well, this modelling technique seems like
a suitable solution for achieving a realistic traffic environment for IVS.

\section{Conclusion}

ITS solutions are often systems integrating a large number of 
actors in a highly dynamic environment. In recent times, modern engineering made it possible 
to equip mobile devices, including road vehicles, with high-performance computers, making 
distributed intelligence a promising field for research, including Intelligent Transport Systems 
research.

The goal of this thesis was to investigate Multi-Agent Systems, which is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence 
research, especially research related to the application of Multi-Agent Systems in Intelligent Transport Systems 
simulation.
