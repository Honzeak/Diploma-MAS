% \subsection{Implementation}

% In relation to the topic of this thesis, it is important to define ITS features that will create a
% qualitative analysis/benchmark for identifying suitable system(s) for the ITS implementation. The following 
% sections will discuss selected features that will be used for deciding which system to implement as a demonstration
% of the proposed agent-based framework.

% deployment.  choosing which ITS to develop 
%  regarding the thesis, Because all of the GDT seem
% to be more or less distinct
% activities, the table below (\ref{gdt-mapping}) was created to map each GDT to particular C-ITS system, which
% will be used to narrow down the potential ITS implementation candidates and hopefully make the final
% decision for ITS implementation clear. 

\subsection{Qualitative analysis}

Looking at the table (\ref{gdt-mapping}), it is evident that all the tasks fall under \emph{four} 
mapping types. Those will be used as entries in the qualitative analysis. Nevertheless,
all types of ITS considered in the preceding sections will be examined and subsequently
evaluated to decide which type of ITS would be the most optimal to implement. 

The method to determine how well-suited the candidate system type is for the implementation to an IVS 
will be to evaluate it based on the \emph{three} features discussed in the preceding sections: 

\begin{itemize}
    \itemspacing{.5}
    \item MAS-compatibility
    \item Driver engagement
    \item Research relevance
\end{itemize}

A set of integer values will determine significance of each feature. The significance
will be given in four levels:

\begin{itemize}
    \itemspacing{.5}
    \item \talign{None}{5}{$\rightarrow$\quad 0}
    \item \talign{Low}{5}{$\rightarrow$\quad 2}
    \item \talign{Moderate}{5}{$\rightarrow$\quad 5}
    \item \talign{High}{5}{$\rightarrow$\quad 8}
\end{itemize}
